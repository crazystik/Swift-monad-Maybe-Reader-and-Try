[Functors, Applicatives, And Monads In Pictures](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html) is extremely well written, with sample code in Haskell though.

In this post I will try to provide proof of concept of Functor/Applicatives/Monad in pure Swift, plus example for using Reader Monad for Dependency Injection(DI), and the idea of Try monad concept from Scala.

# Maybe is Functor

We all know the Optional Type (the ? mark) in Swift. We can define our option type named `Maybe` using enum.
```swift
enum Maybe<T> {
	case Just(T)
	case Nothing
}
```
Simple enough! A `Maybe` type is a "box" which can contains the value or ... nothing

![functor](http://adit.io/imgs/functors/context.png)

The interesting part come from here: we can define a `fmap` function which takes a normal function and a `Maybe` type, then return another `Maybe`

![fmap](http://adit.io/imgs/functors/fmap_apply.png)

How does `fmap` look like? Well, its implement is not that hard
```swift
extension Maybe {
	func fmap<U>(_ f: (T) -> U) -> Maybe<U> {
		switch self {
			case .Just(let x): return .Just(f(x))
			case .Nothing: return .Nothing
		}
	}
}
```

And the "magic" above is actually not-so-magical. At this time, our `Maybe` type is already a **Functor**.

# Maybe is Applicatives
Applicatives is a type which can define the function `apply` that
* Take a function wrapped in that type
* Take also a value wrapped in that type
* Then return a new value which is wrapped also

![applicatives](http://adit.io/imgs/functors/applicative_just.png)

I will define an `apply` function for `Maybe`
```swift
extension Maybe {
	func apply<U>(_ f: Maybe<(T) -> U>) -> Maybe<U> {
		switch f {
			case .Just(let JustF): return self.fmap(JustF)
			case .Nothing: return .Nothing
		}
	}
}
```
That is it! Our `Maybe` now is both **Functor** and **Applicatives**.

# Maybe is Monad

`Maybe` can be considered as a monad if it can define a function `flatmap` that
* Take a function *which return type is* `Maybe`
* Take also a value wrapped in `Maybe`
* Return another `Maybe`

Let's Swift! Here is our `flatMap` and bind operator `>>=`
```swift
extension Maybe {
	func flatMap<U>(_ f: (T) -> Maybe<U>) -> Maybe<U> {
		switch self {
			case .Just(let x): return f(x)
			case .Nothing: return .Nothing
		}
	}
}
infix operator >>= { associativity left }
func >>=<T, U>(a: Maybe<T>, f: T -> Maybe<U>) -> Maybe<U> {
	a.flatMap(f)
}
```

Suppose that we already have a `half` function that return an `Maybe` type
```swift
func half(a: Int) -> Maybe<Int> {
	a % 2 == 0 ? Maybe.Just(a / 2) : Maybe.Nothing
}
```
Then with the `>>=` operator you can chain `Maybe` like:
```swift
Maybe.Just(20) >>= half >>= half >>= half
```

And this is how it is actually processed

![half monad](http://adit.io/imgs/functors/monad_chain.png)

Now our `Maybe` is **Functor**, **Applicatives** and also **Monad** as well.

# A step further, the Reader monad
In this section I will introduce minimal version for one of three useful Monads: the Reader Monad
```swift
class Reader<E, A> {
	let g: (E) -> A
    
	init(g: (E) -> A) {
		self.g = g
	}
    
	func apply(_ e: E) -> A {
		g(e)
	}
    
	func map<B>(_ f: A -> B) -> Reader<E, B> {
		Reader<E, B>{ e in f(self.g(e)) }
	}
	
    func flatMap<B>(_ f: A -> Reader<E, B>) -> Reader<E, B> {
		Reader<E, B>{ e in f(self.g(e)).g(e) }
	}
}
```

![flatMap](http://adit.io/imgs/functors/bind_def.png)

As you can see, we have `map`, and `flatMap` function here. This class type is both **Functor** and **Monad** at the same time. Very same with `Maybe` monad above, `Reader` can define infix operator and chain to whenever we want.
```swift
infix operator >>= { associativity left }
func >>=<E, A, B>(a: Reader<E, A>, f: A -> Reader<E, B>) -> Reader<E, B> {
    a.flatMap(f)
}

func half(i: Float ) -> Reader<Float , Float> {
	Reader { _ in i/2 }
}
let f = Reader{ $0 } >>= half >>= half >>= half
f.apply(20) // 2.5
```


## Why Reader monad matter
Reader monad take `g` function in `init` time. By switching (or *injecting*) this function, we can create our own Dependency Injection(DI) framework easily. Let's see an example:

This is our model:
```swift
struct User {
	var name: String
	var age: Int
}

struct DB {

	var path: String

	func findUser(_ userName: String) -> User {
		// DB Select operation
		User(name: userName, age: 29)
	}

	func updateUser(_ u: User) -> Void {
		// DB Update operation
		print(u.name + " in: " + path)
	}
}
```
and usage:
```swift
let dbPath = "path_to_db"
func update(userName: String, newName: String) {
	let db = DB(path: dbPath)
	var user = db.findUser(userName)
	user.name = newName
	db.updateUser(user)
}
update(userName: "dummy_id", newName: "Thor")
// Thor in: path_to_db
```
In real life `DB` may be compicated and seperated as a whole infrastructure layer. Assume that `DB` can find an user by his name and update his information to the Database.

The problem is `update` function now holding a reference to `dbPath`, which I want to switch during test or runtime. I will rewrite the `update` function to return only a `Reader`
```swift
struct Environment {
	var path: String
}
func updateF(userName: String, newName: String) -> Reader<Environment, Void> {
	return Reader<Environment, Void>{ env in
		let db = DB(path: env.path)
		var user = db.findUser(userName)
		user.name = newName
		db.updateUser(user)
	}
}
```
then call `Reader.apply` later base on what passed through Environment variable.
```swift
let test = Environment(path: "path_to_sqlite")
let production = Environment(path: "path_to_realm")
updateF(userName: "dummy_id", newName: "Thor").apply(test)
// Thor in: path_to_sqlite
updateF(userName: "dummy_id", newName: "Thor").apply(production)
// Thor in: path_to_realm
```

# The Try Monad
Scala's `Try` type is a functional approach for error handling. Very likely to Optional (or `Maybe`), `Try` is a "box" that contains value or a *Throwable* if something has gone wrong. `Try` can be a Successful or a Failure.
```swift
enum Try<T> {

	case Successful(T)
	case Failure(Error)

	init(f: () throws -> T) {
		do {
			self = .Successful(try f())
		} catch {
			self = .Failure(error)
		}
	}
}
```
To make `Try` a functor/monad, I will add `map` and `flatMap` function
```swift
extension Try {
	func map<U>(_ f: (T) -> U) -> Try<U> {
		switch self {
			case .Successful(let value): return .Successful(f(value))
			case .Failure(let error): return .Failure(error)
		}
	}
    
	func flatMap<U>(_ f: (T) -> Try<U>) -> Try<U> {
		switch self {
			case .Successful(let value): return f(value)
			case .Failure(let error): return .Failure(error)
		}
	}
}
```
With an operation which can throws some Error, just wrap them inside a Try and chain(with `map` and `flatMap`) to whenever you want. At every step the result will be a `Try` type. When you want the real value inside that box, just do a pattern matching.
```swift
enum DoomsdayComing: Error {
	case Boom
	case Bang
}

let endOfTheWorld = Try {
	throw DoomsdayComing.Bang
}

let result = Try { 4/2 }.flatMap { _ in endOfTheWorld }
switch result {
	case .Successful(let value): print(value)
	case .Failure(let error): print(error)
}
// Bang
```

# Conclusion
1. A functor is a type that implements map.
2. An applicative is a type that implements apply.
3. A monad is a type that implements flatMap.

![compare](http://adit.io/imgs/functors/recap.png)

* `Maybe` have map, apply and flatMap, so it is a functor, an applicative, and a monad.
* `Reader` is a monad which can be used for DI(Dependency Injection)
* `Try` is a monad, and so as `Future`, `Signal` or `Observable` (see their `flatMap` implement!)
